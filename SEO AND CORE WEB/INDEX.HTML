    <h1>CORE WEB VITALS</h1>
    <p>
Core Web Vitals are a set of metrics from Google that measure the real-world user experience of a webpage, focusing on loading performance, interactivity, and visual stability. They are used as a Google search ranking signal to reward high-quality page experiences. The three main metrics are Largest Contentful Paint (LCP), Interaction to Next Paint (INP), and Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS). 
The three Core Web Vitals
<b>Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):</b> Measures loading performance. A good score is when the largest content element (an image or block of text) on the page is visible within 2.5 seconds.
<b>Interaction to Next Paint (INP):</b> Measures responsiveness. It tracks the latency of all user interactions (like clicks or taps) throughout the page's lifespan and requires a score of 200 milliseconds or less for a good rating. INP replaced First Input Delay (FID) in March 2024.
<b>Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):</b> 
Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) measures how much a webpage's content unexpectedly moves or shifts during loading, impacting user experience and frustration. It's a user-centric metric that quantifies visual stability, and a high score can lead to users accidentally clicking on the wrong elements or being unable to read content as it jumps around. Common causes include images or ads without dimensions, late-loading JavaScript, and fonts or styles being applied late in the loading process. 
What CLS is<BR>
    <OL>
<LI>Measures visual stability: CLS tracks the unexpected shifting of visible elements on a page, which is different from shifts that happen after a user's action.</LI>
<li>Calculated based on impact and distance: It's a formula that considers the area of the viewport the element occupies and the distance the element has moved.</li>
<LI>A Core Web Vital metric: CLS is one of the three key metrics Google uses to measure the user experience of a webpage. 
Why CLS is important</LI>
<LI>Improves user experience: A low CLS score indicates a stable, predictable page that doesn't frustrate users with unexpected movement.
Prevents accidental clicks: Layout shifts can cause buttons or links to move, leading users to click on the wrong thing.</LI>
<LI>Aids in indexing: Google's web crawlers measure CLS, making it an important factor for how search engines view your site's quality. </LI>
<B>Common causes</B>
Images, iframes, and ads without defined dimensions<BR>
Content being injected dynamically via JavaScript<BR>
Late-loading web fonts or styles<BR>

    <h1>SEO</h1>
    <P>
        SEO, or search engine optimization, is the practice of increasing a website's visibility in organic (non-paid) search engine results to drive more traffic. It involves optimizing technical aspects of a site, creating high-quality content, and improving user experience so that search engines like Google and Bing rank the site higher when users search for related topics.

        <B>Core components of SEO</B>
On-page SEO: Optimizing individual web pages to rank higher. This includes using relevant keywords in titles, headings, and content, as well as creating valuable, original information.<BR>
Technical SEO: Improving the technical aspects of a website so search engines can crawl and index it effectively. This includes using semantic HTML and improving site speed and user experience.<BR>
Off-page SEO: Building authority and credibility through actions taken outside of your website. A key part of this is earning backlinks from other reputable websites. <BR><BR>
<B><I>Key goals and benefits</I></B>
Increase organic traffic: By ranking higher, more users will find your site through search results, leading to a significant increase in free, organic traffic.<BR>
Build credibility and trust: Higher rankings often lead users to perceive a site as more credible and trustworthy.<BR>
Improve user experience: Many SEO best practices, such as improving site speed and navigation, directly benefit the user experience.<BR>
Compete with larger sites: SEO allows smaller businesses and websites to compete with larger ones in search engine results pages (SERPs).<BR><BR>

<B>How it works</b>
<B>Search engine crawlers:</B> Search engines use crawlers to scan the web, following links to discover new pages and index their content.<BR>
<B>Indexing:</B> The indexed content is stored and organized, so when a user performs a search, the engine can quickly retrieve relevant results.<BR>
<B>Ranking:</B> Search engines use complex algorithms to rank the indexed content based on hundreds of factors, with the goal of providing the most relevant and helpful results to the user.<BR>
<B>User signals:</B> The user's search query is the starting point. The search engine's goal is to present the user with a list of results that best answer their query.<BR>
